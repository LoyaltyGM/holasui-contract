## Introduction

HolaSui is a platform for builders that allows the creation of gamification experiences on the Sui blockchain using our tools and services, thereby boosting community interest and engagement.

## Modules

- **Staking Module**: Admins can create staking pools for NFTs, and stakers are rewarded with points for their stakes. Stakers can spend points to claim rewards. The admin also has the ability to add rewards to the staking pools.

- **DAO Module**: A basic implementation of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) contract. This module allows for decentralized governance and decision-making processes within the Sui blockchain ecosystem.

- **Suifren DAO and Suifren SubDao Modules**: These modules are specialized implementations of a DAO contract for the SuiFren NFT. Additionally, they introduce the SubDao feature, which enables the creation of SubDaos based on the birth_location attribute of the Suifren NFT. SubDaos are integral parts of the main DAO, providing enhanced organizational structures.
